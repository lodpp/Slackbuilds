blaeu

Blaeu is a set of Python programs to start distributed Internet measurements on
the network of RIPE Atlas probes, and to analyze their results.

- blaeu-reach target-IP-address (test reachability of the target, like ping)
- blaeu-traceroute target-IP-address (like traceroute)
- blaeu-resolve name (use the DNS to resolve the name)
- blaeu-cert name (display the PKIX certificate)

Blaeu requires Python 3.

Usage requires a RIPE Atlas API key (which itself requires a RIPE account), and
RIPE Atlas credits. If you don't have a RIPE account, register first. Once you
have an account, create a key, grant it the right to start new measurements, and
put the key in ~/.atlas/auth. If you don't have Atlas credits, host a probe,or
become a LIR or ask a friend.

A word on RIPE Atlas: ( from https://atlas.ripe.net/about/ )
RIPE Atlas is a global network of probes that measure Internet connectivity and
reachability, providing an unprecedented understanding of the state of the
Internet in real time.

There are thousands of active probes in the RIPE Atlas network, and it is
continually growing. The RIPE NCC collects data from this network and provides
Internet maps, data tools and visualisations based on the aggregated results.
RIPE Atlas users who host a probe can also use the entire RIPE Atlas network to
conduct customised measurements that provide valuable data about their own
network.
