John the Ripper is a fast password cracker.  Its primary purpose is to detect 
weak passwords. The jumbo flavor is a community-enhanced version of JtR.
It adds more hashes, features and optimization. It includes 'lot of
functionality that is not "mature" enough or is otherwise inappropriate for
the official JtR, which in turn also means that bugs in this code are to be
expected' 

For more information, consult the project's homepage and/or the documentation 
installed in /usr/doc/john-1.8.0-jumbo-1

Installation of john-jumbo is mutually exclusive with the official JtR program
also availlable from Slackbuild.org
